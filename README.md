This is the public `README` file for my hello-world project.
So far, not much is planned for this project other than to set it up, add some files, create a branch, and call it a day.

Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm a technical writer, self-taught but also classically trained at Apple and other foundational tech companies. 

Self sufficient but work well on teams.

Have worked on small teams (and in small companies) as well as in very large companies with globally distributed teams. 

I find Agile to be an intuitive way of working on just about anything.
